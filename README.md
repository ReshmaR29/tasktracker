Task Tracker App using ReactJS

Core Features:
Add Task: Users should be able to enter a task name and add it to the task list.
Delete Task: Users should be able to remove tasks from the list by clicking a delete button.
Mark as Completed: Users should be able to mark a task as completed by clicking on it. Completed tasks should have a strike-through effect.
Live Task Updates: The task list should update in real time as users add or remove tasks.
State Management: Tasks should be stored in React’s local state (using useState hook).
UI Feedback: When a user interacts with the app, the UI should provide visual feedback (e.g., strike-through for completed tasks).

Tech Stack:
ReactJS → For building the UI and handling state.
CSS (or Tailwind CSS) → For styling and responsiveness.
